<h1>2025 Reefscape scenary building</h1>

<h2>Barge</h2>
<p>The barge is the place where robots hang themselves up on cages and where robots and processors may shoot or put algae in it to get points. Today we built the two stands of it but did nto finish with it because we didn't have a drill that is long enough to go through the wood.</p>

<h2>Coral</h2>
<p>The coral's base is made up of wood and we built it quickly with wood connection and nails. The upper part of the coral is made up of aluminum profiles and wood connections. we had the wood connections all ready but the aluminum profiles were not able to be built because we ran out of nuts!</p>

<h2>Processor</h2>
<p>The processor went pretty well and we finished it without a problem. the algae was just big enough to go through!(The algaes are huge)</p>

<h2>Loading Station</h2>
<p>This went not good as the holes of the two standings were to small for the wooden cnnnections to go through, so we had to recut it and build it another day.</p>
