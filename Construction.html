<h1>Construction Diary</h1>

<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>From today, I will end preparing and start building my printer! Today, I finished attaching the MGN7 Rails to the E extrusions. Be aware not to let the carriages slide out of the rails. It will be horrible. Believe me. Also, when attaching and sliding the nut bars into the extrusions, remember to take a look at the CADs in the package you downloaded before, it might save you some time! Be aware of the nuts that need to be put but aren't mentioned in the manual. Those that are very obvious will not be said, so use your brain while making this!</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>Today, I finished building the flat for my printer so it will be easier for me to build things later. I somehow lost an aluminum profile, so I had to buy one on the internet and had to wait for several days until it came. This delayed my process a little bit. So remember to keep your things safely inside a box, or you will lose many things.</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>
<p>For day three, I finished building the frame. There was a problem though, one of the holes in one of the aluminum profiles was not in the right spot and one of my printed parts almost cracked because of this. Lessons learned: 1. Check all of the things you have bought before using them. 2. Don't use too much strength when screws can't go in.</p>

<h2>Day 4</h2>
<p>So far, I have finished setting the PMMA board. Tomorrow, I will be starting to build the AB drives.</p>

<h2>Day 5</h2>
<p>I finished building and putting the AB drives onto the frame today. I encountered a problem where I screwed the screw too tightly, so one of the screws slipped out! Next time I need to control my strength so this will not happen again.</p>

<h2>Day 6</h2>
<p>Today, I found a mistake that the retailer made; he sold the wrong type of aluminum profile to me. What's more, when I was inserting the hot melt copper nut into the printed part with a soldering iron, the printed part was crushed a bit accidentally. So I just assembled many parts but did not put any parts together onto the printer.</p>

<h2>Day 7</h2>
<p>After waiting for a week for my things to arrive, I finally continued building my printer. I first finished up the printing platform and put it onto the printer. Next, I cut the belt into two 1-meter sections and passed them through the machine's gears and bearings according to the instructions. And that will be all of what I did today.</p>

<h2>Day 8</h2>
<p>Today, I built the nozzle and put it onto the printing machine. I use the Bamboo X1C nozzle because it not only has a large flow but also is very cheap! You can choose your favorite nozzle as you like; there are all kinds of choices. After finishing with the nozzle, I secured the backboard of the printer. Tip: Keep the nuts that were preloaded in the space before you secure the screws, or you will have a really "fun" time! I also secured the two boards, one Raspberry Pi and one BigTreeTech, onto the frame. Also, there should be a lot of lines outside by now, and you can use cable ties in the holes where the printed parts already have to secure the lines; otherwise, it will be very messy.</p>

<h2>Day 9</h2>
<p>Today, I crimped many terminals and made many wires that connect all kinds of electronics to the PCB board and then to my SKR Pico, which is in charge of all of my printer's actions. I wanted to start building the tophat but didn't because one of the printed parts got lost, and I couldn't start because of that. I haven't stuck my Raspberry Pi to the printer yet because there is something wrong with the systems. That is also the reason why I haven't sealed the box yet.</p>

<h2>Day 10</h2>
<p>I finished building the tophat and putting it onto the printer. I managed to deal with the systematic problems of my Raspberry Pi, but I still haven't sealed the box for final checks and organizing the wires. I will be using cable ties to secure the wires so that they don't get ta...</p>
