<h1>Basics</h1>

<h2>Stepper Motors and Reducers</h2>
<p>Today I learned about stepper motors. A stepper motor is a type of electric motor that moves in discrete steps, allowing precise control over movement. Each step corresponds to a fixed angle of rotation, making stepper motors ideal for applications requiring precise positioning or incremental movement. Unlike other motors that continuously rotate when powered, stepper motors advance a set number of degrees with each pulse of electricity.</p>
<p>However, in competitions like FRC, the need for accuracy and quality is very high, so only stepper motors can not do this. This leads to the second thing I learned today, reducers! The three main kinds of reducers our team will use mainly three types of reducers: planetary reducers, harmonic reducers and Cycloidal reducers.</p>
<p>Planetary reducers, or planetary gearboxes, are compact devices designed to reduce speed and increase torque, featuring a central sun gear, orbiting planet gears, an outer ring gear, and a carrier that holds the planets. This unique configuration distributes load evenly, enabling high torque output, smooth operation, and high efficiency (often over 95%) in a small form factor. They are widely used in applications needing precise, compact, and powerful movement control, such as robotics, automotive transmissions, industrial machinery, and aerospace systems. Though highly effective, planetary reducers tend to be more expensive and complex than simpler gear systems.</p>
<p>Harmonic reducers, or harmonic drive gearboxes, are compact, precise devices used for high reduction ratios with minimal backlash. They consist of a flexible spline, a rigid circular spline, and a wave generator that deforms the flexspline to engage with the circular spline, producing highly accurate rotational movement. Known for their exceptional precision, smooth operation, and ability to achieve large reduction ratios in a single stage, harmonic reducers are ideal for applications like robotics, aerospace, and medical devices where accuracy and compactness are essential. Though highly effective, they can be more costly and may wear faster under heavy impact due to the flexspline's design.</p>
<p>Cycloidal reducers, or cycloidal drives, are compact, high-torque gear reducers that achieve speed reduction through a unique mechanism involving an eccentric cam, a cycloidal disk, and output rollers or pins. As the cam rotates, it drives the cycloidal disk in a cycloidal path, engaging the rollers to transfer motion with minimal backlash and high precision. Known for their durability, ability to handle shock loads, and low vibration, cycloidal reducers are ideal for high-torque applications in industrial machinery, robotics, and conveyors. While highly efficient and precise, they can be complex and may introduce slight vibration due to their operating motion.</p>
